<h1>About the Phage Registry</h1>
<p class="lead">
The CPT's Phage Registry intends to provide a permanent location to registry the names of phages. We hope with this effort we'll be able to defeat the current naming problem that exists in the Phage world.

This site reflects a collaborative effort of the Pittsburgh Bacteriophage Institute (PBI)  and the Center for Phage Technology (CPT) to assist in the naming of novel bacteriophages by serving as a searchable Phage Registry.  It was initially populated by phage name lists from the <a href="http://phagesdb.org/">Mycophage Database</a> and from the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?opt=virus&taxid=10239&host=bacteria">RefSeq database of phages</a> at NCBI.  If you have new phage names or a phage database, please consider letting us include the names in the Registry by contacting us at <a href="mailto:cpt@tamu.edu?subject=New Phage Database">cpt@tamu.edu</a>.  Also, let us know if errors, duplications, or conflicts are detected.

<h3>Why Name Phages?</h3>
<p>
We are still in an era where experiments and analyses are being done with phages or groups of phages.   You have to identify them somehow.   The basic choices are using numbers, alphanumeric strings, or words.  Examples of all three already populate the databases.  It has been common that when investigators start collecting phages for a new host, they have used the letter P (P1, P2, and P22) or Greek letter phi (like phiX174, phi6) and then a number, or some combination of this with a string related to the bacterial species (like SP6, for Salmonella phage 6).  As documented by Kropinski et al. (ref; also, see below), this has often led to confusing situations.  As they pointed out, the canonical coliphage P1 shares its name with at least 5 other phages, and the famous phage K of S. aureus has 10 homonymous phages.  In addition, the use of Greek symbols is problematic for text ordering and searching by databases.

<p>
By far the most extensive phage naming has been done by the PBI, including many phages isolated as part of the “Phage Hunters” (PHIRE) and the HHMI SEA-PHAGES programs (ref).  It is undeniably an attractive feature of these student-based phage-hunting and genomics initiatives that the students involved get to name their phages.   Moreover, it is simply easier to refer to a phage by a name that is easy to say and may have connections to some thing, event, location, personality or concept.  
</p>

<p>
At the CPT, in part because we too use phage genomics as <a href="https://cpt.tamu.edu/bih464">part of a university course</a>, we have adopted this tradition with certain additional features.  Since last year, we have been assigning names that start with M, S, or P for novel phages that have myophage, siphophage or podophage morphology, respectively.

We hope you will be inspired to name your phages and use the registry to avoid duplications.  To that end, we refer you to the excellent “how-to” page of the Mycobacteriophage Database website  that specifies <a href="http://phagesdb.org/namerules/">best practices for your phage naming</a> activities.

<h3>The Kropinski-Prangishvili-Lavigne Convention</h3>
<p>
 In order to provide systemization and sorting capability to the rather disordered world of phage names, Andrew Kropinski, David Prangishvili and Rob Lavigne (ref) have proposed a character string prefix be attached to the common names chosen by the investigators who identify novel phages.   For phages, the prefix vB (bacterial virus) would precede a three letter abbreviation for the bacterial genus and species, followed by a single letter designating the viral family (Table 1) and then common name.   Thus the classic siphophage lambda,  myophage T4 and and podophage P22 would be vB_EcoS_lambda, vB_EcoM_T4,  and vB_StyP_P22.  Viruses (phages) of archaea would be similarly named, except starting with vA.  We think this is a good idea because it will allow easy sorting by primary host and morphology.  In an effort to help this be implemented more widely, we are endeavoring, will try, as time and effort constraints permit, to attach these names as aliases to each phage.  This is simple for nearly all of the phages in the mycophage database, since nearly all are siphophages and thus will be named vB_MsmS_name.   It should be noted that in some of our own Genbank contributions, a three letter abbreviation was actually incorporated into the phage name; thus the Caulobacter phage Colossus appears as CcrColossus.  We are now unsnarling our phage names from this ill advised practice by incorporating the simpler Colossus as an alias pointing to the CcrColossus record.

In addition to providing a registry, we provide a permanent URL that you can use to refer to your phages, much like the DOI service provides for documents. Simply access your phage at <code>https://cpt.tamu.edu/phage-registry/u/PhageName</code>
